			<h1 class="size-56 border light center title">Do You Want <span class="medium red">More Traffic</span>?</h1>
			<p>Well, of course you do…who would ever say they have enough traffic?</p>
			<p>The <strong>REAL</strong> question is — <strong class="red">how do you get more traffic</strong>?</p>
			<p>There are an almost unlimited number of different marketing tactics and strategies, so where do you start? Where do you focus your time?</p>
			<p>Let’s look at SEO for example, Google now uses over <strong class="red">200+ factors</strong> in their algorithm, including <strong>social signals, user-interaction,</strong> and <strong>trust</strong>. How can you know which ones to focus on first?</p>
			<p>The reality is you know that you will <strong>NEVER</strong> be able to hit all 200 the right way.</p>
			<p>Even I don’t focus on everything. Why? Because it’s nearly impossible.</p>
			<p>But I’m still able to get amazing results like no one else because I’ve figured out a handful of tactics that actually <strong>move the needle</strong>.</p>
			<p>Just take a look at the screenshot below…</p>
			<p class="p-img"><img class="shadow" src="images/01.png" alt="" width="699" height="535"></p>
			<p>Now fast forward just <strong class="red">one year</strong> and here is the growth in traffic I was able to produce…</p>
			<p class="p-img"><img class="shadow" src="images/02.png" alt="" width="699" height="535"></p>
			<p><strong class="red">YES</strong> &#8211; That’s right, I increased my traffic by <strong>193%</strong> in one year <strong>without spending a single dollar on advertising</strong>.</p>
			<p class="p-img">If you think that’s impressive, just look at my Google search rankings. Not only do I rank <strong>#1</strong> for “<strong>online marketing</strong>” (one of the most competitive search terms), I also rank <strong>#2</strong>.</p>
			<p class="p-img"><img class="shadow" src="images/03.png" alt="" width="699" height="438"></p>
			<p>Not many people can say that. But you know what’s even more difficult than ranking for “online marketing” in English speaking countries…</p>
			<p>Ranking for top marketing terms in languages like Portuguese in Brazil, where you don’t even speak the language.</p>
			<p class="p-img"><img class="shadow" src="images/04.png" alt="" width="699" height="402"></p>
			<p>Who wouldn’t want more traffic that way? And if you think that’s amazing, check out how I implemented one unconventional tactic that <strong>grew my search traffic by 51% in just 3 months</strong>.</p>
			<p>Here’s my traffic <strong>before</strong> I started using the tactic…</p>
			<p class="p-img"><img class="shadow" src="images/05.png" alt="" width="699" height="535"></p>
			<p>And here’s my traffic <strong>after</strong> I stopped leveraging that tactic…</p>
			<p class="p-img"><img class="shadow" src="images/06.png" alt="" width="699" height="478"></p>
			<p>Not only was I able to grow my traffic using one crazy tactic, but I was able to maintain the traffic after I stopped using it.</p>
			<p>As you can see from the screenshots above, <strong>I know my stuff</strong>. This is what I do better than anybody —  rapidly boost traffic and grow businesses.</p>
			<p>Even in the most competitive industries I am able to crush it and find a unique advantage, and I’ve done the same for tons of companies.</p>
			<p>Sure, I’m not competing with billion dollar corporations, but I do compete in the most competitive niche there is…marketing. Just think about it…I am competing with people like me.</p>
			<p><strong>Yet still, I’m winning and outperforming them all&#8230;</strong></p>
			<p>This is the main reason I’ve been able to work with so many household names and big brands, like the ones below.</p>
			<p class="p-img"><img class="img-c" src="images/07.png" alt="" width="576" height="222"></p>
			<p>If you think what I did for my own sites is impressive, the results I’m able to create for these big companies is even more crazy.</p>
			<p>But&#8230;these big guys don’t allow you to “showcase” their stats publicly. The most they can provide is generic testimonials like these…</p>

			<p>They don’t mind me showcasing the results I provided for them… but in reality they are nothing compared to what I’ve done for many of the bigger brands I’ve worked with.</p>
			<p>Just like the results I provided for the two small businesses or to some of the big brands I’ve listed above, the <strong>ONE THING</strong> I’ve mastered is <strong>driving more qualified traffic to virtually any business online</strong>.</p>
			<p>I’ve gotten so good at helping companies get results that I now have <strong>over 4,500 people</strong> competing to work with me each <strong>MONTH</strong>.</p>
			<p>Companies do crazy things just to get access to me and pick my brain…</p>
			<p>Like when five <em>Fortune 1000 companies each bought $100,000 worth of my book</em> so I could hit the New York Times Bestseller list.</p>
			<p>So the real question isn’t if I can grow your traffic… <em>it’s whether or not I actually want to work with you…</em></p>
			<p>As I mentioned above, I get 4,500 leads a month for consulting.</p>
			<p>But I’m not a salesperson, I honestly hate sales more than anything else. <strong class="red">I’m a techie… a math guy… I’m a marketer…</strong> which is why I took down most of my consulting lead forms.</p>
			<p>I like focusing on what I am good at and only that, which is: <strong>driving traffic to websites</strong>.</p>
			<p>SO — if you want to work with me and grow your business like the examples above, keep reading…</p>

				<h2 class="size-48 light border"><span class="size-22 medium red step">Step 1</span> Do This Now</h2>
				<p><strong><a class="underline btn-popup-form" href="#">Start by clicking here!</a></strong></p>
				<p>You’ll see a brief series of questions you’ll need to answer about your business.</p>
				<p>Nothing too crazy, I just need the basics about what you’re working on, what you sell, etc. That way we can understand your situation before we talk and get right to business. </p>
				<p>Answer these questions as accurately as possible, and be absolutely sure your contact information is correct so we can reach you.</p>
				<h2 class="size-48 light border"><span class="size-22 medium red step">Step 2</span> Here’s What Will Happen Next</h2>
				<p>Once you’ve filled out the questionnaire, Scott (from my office) will call you to speak more about your business and gather more information so we can accurately plan out how to grow your website.</p>
				<p>It’s important that you answer the questionnaire thoroughly because if you don’t our analysis of your business will be off, which means we won’t know how much more traffic and sales we can drive to your business.</p>
				<p>You will hear from us within 24 business hours after submitting your application.</p>
				<p>Your initial call will be between 30 and 45 minutes. This is where we really begin working to figure out exactly what you need, and how to make it happen.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="inner">
			<p>At that point if you see the value in working together, great. We’ll talk and see if I’m able to take you on as a client.</p>
			<p>If you don’t want to move forward, that’s fine too.
			</p>
			<p>Worst case you would have received some free advice from my team and I which will help you generate more traffic and sales.</p>
			<p>Ultimately this is for people who take action and know a good opportunity when they see one.</p>
			<p>If that’s you, today is the day you step up and take your business to the next level.</p>
			<p><strong>Click the button below to submit your application.<br>My team will be in touch ASAP to schedule a time to chat.</strong></p>
